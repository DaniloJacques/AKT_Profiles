-----------
AKT is a fanthastic optimisation package that improves battery life with minimal (or null) smoothness impact.

Now I'm trying to port Project Zhana, one for the best AKT profiles, to midrange processor Snapdragon 660. It comes with 4xKyro 260 Gold (A73-based) + 4xKyro 260 Silver (A53-based).

The bad is the natural difference between Snapdragon 820 (four powerful cores) and 660 (eight less powerful cores). The goal is reach the same logic that AKT had success for SD820 to 660.
